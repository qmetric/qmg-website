One of our QA engineers put together a `Policy Expert` themed mini-game
using Javascript and HTML5. This game is entirely client side and uses
side-scrolling animation.

"I made this game to teach myself Javascript," said Oliver Bray, the
creator of this game. "It's really effing hard."

Here's the game description and link:
