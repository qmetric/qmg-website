Plenty of posts out there on the benefits of information radiators and
Big Visible Displays but I thought I'd share our implementations.

We currently have 6 radiators which help raise the team's awareness of
various aspects of our ecosystems - infrastructure, application
performance, build monitor, logging behaviour and financial metrics.

There's no reason other teams, such as marketing, could not have their
own real-time radiators, the barriers to entry are quite low.

Hardware:

-  1 ErgoMounts EMVPF1300-1X4-21B quad floor stand
-  2 Dell Ultrasharp U2412M 24 inch IPS Widescreen LED Monitors
-  2 H-Squared Mounts for Mac mini Unibody
-  2 Mac minis
-  2 Mac mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapters

Software:

-  Google Chrome extensions Tab revolver and auto-refresh
-  `Sentry`_ dashboard for exception logging / tracking
-  `Geckoboard`_ dashboard for Company financial metrics and Pingdom
   report displays
-  `Highcharts`_ and `Codahale Metrics`_ (developed by Yammer) for
   realtime application performance monitoring
-  `JUnitBenchmarks`_ for performance testing
