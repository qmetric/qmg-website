What's it Like Working with Us?
===============================

We are 16 agile (small ‘a’) software engineers in the heart of the City
building a best-in-class `insurance platform`_. We are always looking
for developers who understand scale, non-functional requirements and the
production environment. We are very interested in automation and the
culture that goes with it.

We believe in...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  No Project Managers - we believe in hands-on delivery, not managing
   expectations.
-  No heirarchy - we are flat in structure and everyone has the same
   opportunity to step up!
-  No hiding places - Production is the ultimate phase in the SDLC and
   we are proud of our code.
-  No legacy code - Greenfield platform with the latest tools and
   technologies.
-  High barrier to entry - Expect to code, pair and whiteboard during
   your application. If you do well and it’s Friday you might also get
   to play Team Fortress.

We will always try to use the right tools...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Brand new 27” iMac’s - We invest in excellence in both people and
   tools.
-  Amazon AWS - Highly scalable initial architecture proving it’s worth
   in Amazon datacentres.
-  Agile - We are re-evaluating all the time, incorporating new ideas,
   ditching old ones. Don’t expect to sit still for too long...
-  Top drawer performance - Proud of our Google Page Speed `result`_,
   millisecond quote engine calculations, 85% code coverage and 11/12 on
   the `Joel Test`_.
-  The good stuff - AWS, Linux, Puppet, Capistrano, Ruby, Continuous
   Integration / Deployment, Java 6, MySQL, Tomcat 7, Apache 2.2,
   Hibernate, Spring, Git, GitHub, Maven, Nexus, OSSEC, Ajax,
   JavaScript, IntelliJ, TeamCity...

Who we want to work with...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of our roles requires that you have extensive experience in Open
Source and web-based technologies. Other key attributes include:

-  Demonstrated delivery of high-availability, scalable web applications
   and architectures.
-  Experience of the full SDLC - must include production systems and
   trouble-shooting.
-  Willing to tell us why you’re exceptional and what makes you that
   way.
-  Able to tell us where we can improve and to challenge the status quo.
-  Ultimately, you will need to be “smart and able to get things done”.

   <div>

We’re passionate about insurance (yes, really) and we wanted to improve
the way people thought about and bought their insurance cover.

We wanted to go further than any comparison site and do more for
customers than simply provide quotes.

So, in a nutshell, we wanted to make buying insurance an easy,
refreshing experience where everything was taken care of from start to
finish.

After putting our heads together, we decided to form Policy Expert. An
online service that would look after each customer from their first
quote right through to making a claim.

We didn’t want to help people just buy a policy. We wanted to help them
find just the right policy for them.

We got together with lots of talented people and carefully designed our
service to make it simple, quick, upfront and full of handy features. We
also set up a dedicated customer service team to offer expert help every
step of the way.

Customer satisfaction is always at the heart of everything we do. It’s
important to us that you feel absolutely confident in the level of
insurance you’ve bought – that’s our priority.
