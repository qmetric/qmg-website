                        <p>We’re a group of experienced professionals who became disenchanted with many of the common practices of the industry.  Frustrated with the poor reputation insurance has with consumers, we decided to combine forces to do things differently.</p>
                        <p>By bringing together talented individuals from a range of businesses our focus is on delivering market-leading products which place the customer at the heart of all aspects of the insurance journey.  We merge skills developed at a wide range of organisations, from global blue chip companies, dynamic <abbr title="Small and medium enterprise">SME</abbr>s and leading high street retail brands.</p>

Customer service doesn’t stop at the point of sale, that’s where it begins.  Whether it’s a comment on our policies, our service or an idea; if there’s a point to be made, we’re all ears.</p>

                    <p>Insurance is a necessary evil: without it there’s risk of significant financial loss, but when purchased, it’s often hard to see the value in something that can’t be seen or felt.  When buying insurance, an individual is buying a promise - that when something goes wrong that company will sort it out.</p>
                    <p>Our promise is to make the insurance experience as simple, transparent and uncomplicated as possible. Championing the consumer is the foundation of everything we do.</p>
                    <p>Clear, digestible information so customers make an informed decision and know exactly what they’re buying and what it does and doesn’t cover.</p>

                    <p>Policy Expert is a new type of insurance broker that goes that little bit further. Launched in 2011, Policy Expert combines the transparency of a price comparison site with the personalised services of a traditional broker. We work with leading insurers, all with an established reputation for cover levels, service and claims handling.</p>
                    <h2 class="hdr-sub hdr-sub-lrg">At QMetric we listen to customers and invest in insurer relationships. Good customer service comes as standard on all our brands.</h2>
                    <p>We have been able to design a number of exclusive policies targeted at a wide range of insurance needs:</p>
                    <p>VFM stands for Value For Money. It’s a policy that removes many of the (often unnecessary) added extras commonly found in standard policies. It gives customers seeking essential cover the core reassurance they need at a price to suit their wallet.</p>
                    <p>PRIMO is our premium insurance brand that offers comprehensive cover levels at affordable prices.</p>
