        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>Founded in 2010, before 'InsurTech' was even a word, we set out to redefine what an insurer should be.
            By building our own tech and owning the process end to end, we've streamlined how people buy insurance.

                    <h4>How does QMetric use cookies?</h4>

                    <p>If you visit the QMetric website, we collect information about your online preferences in a
                        "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) which is stored on your computer or mobile
                        phone. QMetric uses cookies for a range of purposes e.g. to personalise content or to monitor
                        traffic on our website.
                    </p>

                    <p>When visiting our website, you may see some cookies created that are not related to QMetric. This
                        is because some features on our website use services provided by other companies' websites.
                        Those companies control and are responsible for the creation of those cookies.
                    </p>

                    <p>Most browsers allow you to set your cookie preferences so that you can decide how you would like
                        to interact with our website: whether to be notified interactively about cookies or to accept or
                        reject all cookies. Since each browser is different you should check the Help menu in your
                        browser to determine how to do this.

                        don't accept them, some parts of the QMetric website may not function properly or in some cases
